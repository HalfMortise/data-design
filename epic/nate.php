			<h4>Attitude:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li class="wide-container">Nate is used to the ease of accessing apps with minimal clicks, and expects his Netflix experience to be no different.  In addition to ease of access, he doesn’t want his feed to be cluttered with irrelevant content or recommendations for TV shows and movies that he has no interest in.  He would like some control over managing that content.</li>
			</ul>
				<h4>Likes:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li class="wide-container">Apps with ease of access and ease of use</li>

			</ul>
		<h4>Technological Needs:</h4>
			<ul>

			<ul>
				<li class="wide-container">He does not like irrelevant content on his page</li>
				<li class="wide-container">He does not like having to constantly perform a search to find a show/movie that he is currently interested in</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>Comfort level: high</h4>

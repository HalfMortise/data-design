			<h4>Attitude:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li class="wide-container">Nate is used to the ease of accessing apps with minimal clicks, and expects his Netflix experience to be no different.  In addition to ease of access, he doesn’t want to be bothered with having to search for what he was viewing last, and would like to be able to quickly pick up where he left off with whatever content was last accessed.</li>
			</ul>
				<h4>Likes:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li class="wide-container">Apps with ease of access and ease of use</li>

				<li class="wide-container">He does not like having to constantly perform a search to find a show/movie that he is currently interested in</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>Comfort level: high</h4>
